# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Project Overview
### Analysis to determine which current employees are approaching retirement age based on a date of birth between 1952 and 1955.  This is to help Pewlett Hackard to plan for this wave of retirees and ensure there is no disruption to their work force.
### Systems Used: Using Postgresql, CSV, and Visual Studio

Upon receiving the raw data files an ERD was created to map the primary keys between all the tables.

How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
